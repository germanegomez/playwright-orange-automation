  SanityTest:
    #? The "Sanity" Pipeline is a perfect testing strategy to verify that an entire module of the app  
    #? or a specific functionality works as expected. Tests at any level (Unit, Integration, E2E) can be  
    #? performed using this strategy. It is also used as "Story Testing" for US coverage test executions  
    #? (importing results into Jira XRay).
